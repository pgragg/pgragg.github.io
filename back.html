		<p> Ruby is a fun and powerful programming language, used by professional coders all over the world. You can take 15 minutes to just <a href="http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0">try it out</a>. <br><br>If you like Ruby, and want to learn more about how to use your computer to solve problems, check out Codecademy's <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby">Ruby </a>track. It will teach you how to easily write professional-level Ruby code.</p> 

		<p> Ruby isn't the <em>only</em> language out there. It's just my favorite because it is powerful, professional, and simple. Other languages (that you can also learn online for free) include Python, JavaScript, Java, and PHP. Each of these languages has its strengths and weaknesses, and many professional developers could spend their entire day arguing about the merits of each one. Rather than spending a lot of time right now talking about the languages, it's more important that we each just pick one and learn it well enough to solve some puzzles!  </p>
		<p> Worried you'll pick the "wrong one"? Don't worry: the basic building blocks of all programming are the same: iterators, functions, loops, variables, and other ideas will carry over between languages, so that an experienced programmer might only take a week or two to become entirely comfortable in a new language! </p> 
		<p> DISCLAIMER: Programming is hard. Like anything worthwhile, it will be difficult and sometimes frustrating to learn. Sometimes it will feel like you are no good. That's a normal feeling to have when taking on a challenging task. Take a break if you like, and then keep learning! </p>

		<p>If you're a more advanced programmer, you may want to start working on challenges. Here are some websites you can use to practice. Some, like codeeval, even offer real world prizes to top coders! </p> 

		<p>Don't worry: if these challenges are too difficult for you, try completing some of Codecademy's <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby"> Ruby</a> track first. You should be able to handle many of these questions after completing that track!</p>

		<p><a href="http://jsdares.com">Jsdares.com</a> provides fun beginner challenges that will be difficult for the beginner who has never programmed or used Scratch before. Their challenges use psuedo code to teach you to think like a programmer.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.codeeval.com">Codeeval.com</a> is a great place to test your knowledge of code.</p>
		<p><a href="http://coderbyte.com/">Coderbyte.com</a> offers <em>timed</em> easy, medium, and hard questions, and is a great place to improve your knowledge.</a>
		<p><a href="http://www.codewars.com/">Codewars.com</a> offers short coding challenges in 14 difficulty levels, and in multiple languages. The best part is that you can see other people's solutions to the problem. There are usually many ways of solving a problem, so you're bound to learn something even if you devise a correct answer!</a>

			<li>Improve upon, or create a clone of, <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/g024w422/">this simple "Cookie Clicker" game</a> written in <a href="http://coffeescript.codeschool.com/">CoffeeScript</a>, HTML, and CSS. Feel free to compare it to the real Cookie Clicker game. You'll probably have to learn CoffeeScript first: it's worth the time!</li>
			<li>Create your own coding challenge on codewars.com. Share it with the club! </li>
			<li>Find my page on <a href="https://github.com/pgragg">Github</a> and fork a project. Improve on this website, and we'll put your name in the credits page! (The credits page still needs to be built.. I wonder who could do that?)</li>
